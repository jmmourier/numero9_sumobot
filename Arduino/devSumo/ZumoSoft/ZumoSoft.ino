/*
 * This example uses tÃ¹he ZumoMotors library to drive each motor on the Zumo
 * forward, then backward. The yellow user LED is on when a motor should be
 * running forward and off when a motor should be running backward. If a
 * motor on your Zumo has been flipped, you can correct its direction by
 * uncommenting the call to flipLeftMotor() or flipRightMotor() in the setup()
 * function.
